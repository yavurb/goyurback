# GoYurback

A backend built using Go to work as the main backend for yurb.dev.

This backend is also the core hearth for all the features
of yurb.dev and a proxy-like backend for future projects.

> This project is a rewrite of the original backend that was built using Python.
> You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/yavurb/yurback)
